## üìò Overview

This project focuses on building a robust pipeline to detect hate speech from social media content using five different machine learning models. The dataset is preprocessed using advanced NLP techniques and then fed into models for training, evaluation, and comparison.

---

## üöÄ Objectives

- Classify text as hate speech, offensive language, or neither.
- Compare the performance of 5 different machine learning algorithms.
- Use TF-IDF and CountVectorizer for feature extraction.
- Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
